### img-100 Subset Class Selections
The specific class selections for the five img-100 subsets used in this study are available in this repository. These subsets were randomly sampled from the original ImageNet-1K dataset, each consisting of 100 classes. The selected classes for each subset are provided to ensure transparency and reproducibility of the experiments conducted in the paper.
